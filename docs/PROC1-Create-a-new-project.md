# Create a new project

In this procedure, we will create a new C project on CLion. To be able to use CLion, it is essential to know how to properly set up a new project. After completion, your project will contain a main file to put your code in, and it will have the compiler for the project set up.

## Instructions

1. Open CLion.

   You should now be in the [starting window].

2. Click **New Project**.

5. ⚠ Only change the language standard from **C99** to a previous version if you specifically want to create a backward compatible application.

Congratulations, you have successfully created a new C project on your CLion application.t

✓ You should be able to see your project's path in the project pane.
