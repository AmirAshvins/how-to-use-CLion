# Create a new project

In this procedure, we will create a new C project on CLion. After completion, your project will contain a main file to put your code in, and it will have the compiler for the project set up.

1. Open CLion.

   You should now be in the [starting window]

2. Click **New Project**.

3. Click **C Executable**.

    ![right-click-on-project-directory](https://github.com/AmirAshvins/how-to-use-CLion/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/proc1-image2.png?raw=true "Right click on project directory")

4. Enter the desired path for the new project ending with its name.

5. ⚠ Only change the language standard from **C99** to a previous version if you specifically want to create a backward compatible application.
    {: .label .label-yellow }

    Choose the desired **language standard** click **create**.

Congratulations, you have successfully created a new C project on your CLion application.

    ✓ Next to the main directory in the project pane it should state the path to your project.
