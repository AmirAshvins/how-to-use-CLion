# Create a new project

In this procedure, we will create a new C project on CLion. After completion, your project will contain a main file to put your code in, and it will have the compiler for the project set up.

## Instructions:

1. Open CLion.
2. On the right pane in the starting window, beneath CLion’s Logo, click **New Project**.

3. On the right pane of the newly opened window, click **C Executable**, the 3rd option from the top.

4. Enter the path of your new project ending with the name of it in the **Location** box.

    ★ It is recommended not change the full path but only the name of the project by replacing it with "untitled" as it would contain all the CLion projects in the CLionProjects' directory folder.

5. Choose the **Language Standard** by clicking on its drop-down menu and click **create**.

    ⚠ Only change the language standard from **C99** to a previous version if you specifically want to create a backward compatible application.

6. Congratulations, you have successfully created a new C project on your CLion application.

    Check for success: You should now be in the [main window], main directory in the project pane should state the path to your project.
