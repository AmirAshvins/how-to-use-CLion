**Code Generation:** CLion's editor will generate some commonly used code among programmers such as the main function or methods for a class (only applicable for c++ language).

**Compiler:** A Compiler acts as a translator that translates a given source code (code written by developers) into machine langugage. There are different compilers for different programming languages.

**Executable file:** Files in CLion will can not always be executed (be ran) and everything must be in the main.c file. However there is a possible way to make files in CLion executbale, i.e: run the files by themselves and let them having a main function for their own.

**Git:** Git is a distributed version control system that tracks any changes in a system. It is mostly used by programmers in the developement stages of a product.

**GitHub:** GitHub is a Git reposetory hosting service that allows sharing products that have git on the cloud.

**Language Standard:** Language Standard refers to the different avaibale versions of a programming language to be chosen as the only version used in a specific CLion project.

**on-the-fly-Code-AnalysisL:** The CLion's editor will check the code, based on the language used, and the rules you specify and highlight warnings and errors as you type.

**Refactoring:** Refactoring is regarded as the process of restructring the computer code to improve the design and reability of it.

**Relative path:** Every file in the oporating system will have a directory path that is used to obtain and visit the file which is called the Absolute path. The relative path in the other hand refers to the path of a file relative to another file (i.e: path of a file in CLion relative to the path of the CLion application itself)

**Reposetory:** In software development, a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems such as GitHub to store multiple versions of files.

**Version Control:** Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
