# How to use CLion - An exploration of documentation production

"How to use CLion" helps the inexperienced user to begin producing meaningful work on JetBrains' C/C++ IDE.

## The values

"How to use CLion" was created by a team of two, Karel Chanivecky and Amirali Askari. We believe in creating products that are useful, and accessible. To achieve this, we used strict style guidelines and purposeful comminication. This resulted in a documentation package that is easy to understand and mainainable.

## The structure

To accomplish these objectives the documentation was built upon [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), a Jekyll extension. This tool creates the skeleton of the document, allowing the producer to focus on creating quality content.

## The language

To further facilitate the creation of content, [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) markup was used as styling aid. Markdown is a language that is compiled into HTML. It provides for much of the functionality needed for a static text webpage. However its source coude can be easily read by the non-technical user.

## The style

[Google's developer documentation guideline](https://developers.google.com/style) was used to mantain a unified style thorughout the documentation. Google's guideline helps the producer create a documentation that is consistent with ubiquitous web heuristics. Thus, the resulting documentation is easier to follow by the user, who should be habituated to Google's style.

## The challenge

To accomplish our goals we faced many challenges. First, was writing in a unified voice. This was emphasized by the fact that the project was developed while maintaining 100% of communication online due to the COVID-19 international crisis. Next, was learning the use of Markdown and Jekyll themes. Finally and most important, creating a set of instructions that any type of user can complete with confidence. This is extremely hard, as we had to anticipate the wide range of experience and work environment of our users.

We would like to invite you to browse through our work and welcome any feedback, questions or requests.

All the best,

Karel C., Amirali A.
