# How to use CLion - An exploration of documentation production

"How to use CLion" demonstrates the process of designing and producing documentation that is effective, easy to use and accessible.

To accomplish these objectives, the latest tools and guidelines where used. The documentation was built upon [just-the-docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs), a Jekyll extension. This tool creates the skeleton of the document, allowing the producer to focus on creating quality content.

To further facilitate the creation of content, [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) markup was used as styling aid. Markdown is a language that is compiled into HTML. It provides for much of the functionality needed for a static text webpage. However its source coude can be easily read by the non-technical user.

The content itself was written using [Google's developer documentation guideline](https://developers.google.com/style). Google's guideline helps the producer create a documentation that is consistent with ubiquitous web heuristics. Thus, the resulting documentation is easier to follow by the user, who should be habituated to this style.

The content itself was created by a team of two to stress the importance of writing a unified voice. Amirali Askari and I, Karel Chanivecky, would like to invite you to browse through our work. We welcome any feedback, questions or requiests to use our work.

All the best,

Karel C., Amirali A.
